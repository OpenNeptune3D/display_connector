# Firmware and UI Editing Instructions

This repository contains a `.tft` file which is the firmware that you need to flash onto the screen. 

In the `Source_Firmware` folder, you will find a `.HMI` file. This is the file you should edit if you want to make changes to the user interface (UI). 

The `Source_Firmware` folder also contains the TJC Editor, which is the program you will need to use to edit the `.HMI` file. Please note that the TJC Editor is only available in Chinese.

## Important Note on Using the TJC Editor

When using the TJC Editor, please be aware that it uses IDs. If you are adding anything new and not replacing existing elements, make sure to add it so that it is appended at the bottom. This will help maintain the integrity of the UI and prevent any potential conflicts or errors.
