# Firmware and UI Editing Instructions

This repository contains a `.tft` file which is the firmware that you need to flash onto the screen. 

In the `Source_Firmware` folder, you will find a `.HMI` file. This is the file you should edit if you want to make changes to the user interface (UI). 

The `Source_Firmware` folder also contains the TJC Editor, which is the program you will need to use to edit the `.HMI` file. Please note that the TJC Editor is only available in Chinese.
